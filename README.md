## Project Planning 
* I will be making a typescript react project using create-react-app - not the recommend way these days but easiest for a small project like this.
* Styled Components for styling  - keeps code clean compared to tailwind (in my opinion)
* React Testing Library for testing (pre installed with react a project which keeps things simple)
* React Router for routing - simple navigation solution

## Project Structure
# Pages
* Home - main page with idea board / list of ideas
* Create Idea - page to create a new idea
* Edit Idea - page to edit an existing idea

# Components
* Navigation Bar - simple navigation bar
* Idea Card - card to display an idea
* Idea Form - form to create or edit an idea

# Design
* Blue - represents meanings of depth, trust, loyalty, sincerity, wisdom, confidence, stability, faith, and intelligence.
* Imagery - Search for images related to ideas, creativity, innovation, etc.
* Repsonsize - Mobile first design
